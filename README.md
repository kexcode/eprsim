EPR Simulator App v.3.0.1

## Description:

An educational app for the EPR spectral simulations. The purpose of this app is to get user familiar with the EPR spectra calculations using [EasySpin](https://easyspin.org) package. All the basic routines are borrowed from the latest [EasySpin](https://easyspin.org) release.

## Features:

* EPR spectra calculation are using [**pepper**](https://easyspin.org/easyspin/documentation/pepper.html) (solid state EPR).

* Orientation selection via specifying the [Euler angles](https://easyspin.org/easyspin/documentation/eulerangles.html) for single crystal orientation

* Energy level diagram is plotted only for selected orientation

* The input values have to be in the correct format

* Loading of 1-dimentional EPR spectra (pulse and CW, but only .DSC files) is supported

* Saving parameters as a matlab structure is supported
